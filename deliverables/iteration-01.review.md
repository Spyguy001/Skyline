# SKYLINE

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: 12th October
 * Where: Online over Discord 

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

 1. In-depth construction of each idea presented allowed for the selection of the best possible project in accordance to the team's skills. Each of the main ideas (Condo App, Info Sharing, Quiz App) were thoroughly researched and considered in terms of viable implementation and consumer demand.
 
2. Consideration of the various ways to implement the project (Website vs. Android App/Desktop Application) and the skills required for each implementation. This uncovered many of the flaws and advantages to each approach allowing us to select the ideal platform.

3. All conflicts within the team during the planning phase were resolved quickly and gracefully. This allowed for the focus to be shifted onto the project itself.


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

1. Coding has been delayed due to a lack of conclusive decisions and initiative. While the planning was very thorough this resulted in a slow start towards actually implementing the selected idea.

2. Indecisiveness in the selection of the project idea delayed the planning of the details related to the implementation itself.

3. Disorganization in the various forms of communication resulted in splintered information. Various important notes are scattered across different apps and websites.



#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

- We are planning to change our modes of communication and task delegation. 
  Until now, we've been communicating on numerous platforms such as Slack, Discord, Messenger, etc. simultaenously, which is making our communication difficult due to having to check so many plaforms for a single piece of information. We plan on moving all of the records and communication onto a single platform to eliminate that problem. We are also delegating tasks manually for now, which does not follow Scrum methodology and is inefficient. We plan on changing this and using either Jira or Github Issues to track our progress and delegate tasks to people in the group.

- We are also planning to change our meeting times and make them more
 regular. Due to the highly conflicting schedules of everyone in the group, it is difficult to coordinate meetings and thus we cannot have them at a regular time without coordinating many things. We plan on making a schedule and sticking to it so that we do not have to schedule each meeting individually.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

The goals and tasks are ordered by significance (1 most important, 5 least important)
 - Goal: Decide the medium of our project, it can be either a web, a pc software or an android/ios app. 
     - Completed tasks： Most of us voted for java in the tutorial, so we will do one PC version for condo managements and one mobile version (android)
        for condo residents. They will have different functions but share the same databse. 

 - Goal: Decide the basic API and what we need to code at the first stage.  
     - Completed tasks: Amrit, Krishna and Aleksey had an online meeting and sketch out all the basic attributes and methods for the product. 
   As a group we also set up our repo when it was out.

 - Goal: have a basic UI design of the app. <br/>
     - Completed tasks: Josh used prototyping tool “proto” and sketched out the basic UI for our product.
   Link to the artifact (prototyping of our product): https://pr.to/4NXMPC/

 - Goal: have a more precise MVP with features that really satisfy what users need. 
     - Completed Tasks: Fernanda conducted user researches with both condo residents and condo managements. 
     We know better about the users’ needs and we now can implement our MVP features more precisely.

    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B9KGFasMab2RNqD6bPchmsC3ocGAHtgGSqlJKvfqtc4/edit

 - Goal (not in the original plan but found out as it is necessary): Choose a good team/product name.  
     - Completed Tasks: We decided to name our product “Skyline” as a result of an online discussion.


#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

The goals and tasks are ordered by significance (1 most important, 5 least important)

 - Goal: Decide the basic API and what we need to code at the first stage. 
     - Tasks not completed: Although we have decided our basic API, we actually did not draw a UML for it.
     - Reason: Amrit, Krishna and Aleksey feel it is enough to have just the descriptions of our API at this stage.
     It will be drawn  if we have more time and more detailed API in the future. 


 - Goal: Decide the database and consider any potential languages/developing software/websites we might use. 
    - Task not completed: Fernanda and Sumit conducted some researches but it is still not decided which database to use.  
    - Reason: Databse will play a vital role in the communication between residents and Managers and we are taking time in
  making the decision.
  

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

- Allocating different aspects of the MVP to groups of people
  - Allocate the responsibility to implement features in the MVP
    to groups of people
- Finalizing the timeline for the product
  - Have a detailed breakdown of the timeline for the completion 
    of the MVP
- Setting up the database
  - Set up the schema for the databse
  - Ensure everyone understands how to manipulate the database
- Implement Accounts aspect of the product 
  - Implementing the registration page
  - Implementing the login page
  - Separating User Accounts from Admin Accounts
