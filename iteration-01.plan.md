# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your initial planning meeting.     
 > It does not really make sense for you to edit this document much (if at all) while working on the project - Instead, at the end of the planning phase, you can refer back to this document and decide which parts of your plan you are happy with and which parts you would like to change.


## Iteration XX

 * Start date: FILL IN THE DATE WHEN YOU HAD YOUR FIRST TEAM PLANNING MEETING
 * End date: FILL IN THE DATE WHEN YOU ARE PLANNING TO HAVE YOUR REVIEW MEETING

## Process

_This entire section is optional. Note that you will have to fill it out and more for the next 3 deliverables so it's good to start soon and get feedback._ 

#### Roles & responsibilities

Describe the different roles on the team and the responsibilities associated with each role.

#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:

 * When and where? In-person or online?
 * What's the purpose of each meeting?
 * Other events could be coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync' meeting online, etc.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

 * Artifacts can be To-do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * How do you prioritize tasks?
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?


## Product

_This entire section is mandatory._

#### Goals and tasks

The goals and tasks are ordered by significance (1 most important, 5 least important), tasks are specified by user stories. 

1.Goal: Decide the medium of our project, it can be either a web, a pc software or an android/ios app. 
Tasks: As a team of app developers, we want to ask the professor/TA about which platform is better for a condo management app and do a vote to choose the ideal platforms, so that our app will have more potential users. 

2.Goal: Decide the basic api and what we need to code at the first stage
Tasks: As a dev team who just start work on their project, we need to draw a UML graph and set up repo, so that we know what is the basic api look like and get ready to work on it.
  
3. Goal: have a more precise MVP with features that really satisfy what users need
Tasks: As a team of app developers, we want to conduct user researches by interview/do questionnaire with condo managements and residents, so that we will really understand what users need and implement our MVP features more precisely. 

4.Goal: have a basic UI design of the app
Tasks: As a dev team who just start work on their project, we want to sketch out the first prototype of our product, so we will know what is our UI look like and have a better understanding about our product.

5.Goal: Decide the database and consider any potential languages/developing software/websites we might use 
Task: As a team of app developers who have not really started coding, we want to ask the professor/TA and do some researches about what developing software or websites we might use and decide the best database for our product, so that we can directly get to work when it come to the second or third deliverable. 


#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
