# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: 12th October
 * Where: Online over Discord 

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.


 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).


#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

* We are planning to change our modes of communication and task delegation. Until now, we've been communicating on numerous platforms such as Slack, Discord, Messenger, etc. simultaenously, which is making our communication difficult due to having to check so many plaforms for a single piece of information. We plan on moving all of the records and communication onto a single platform to eliminate that problem. We are also delegating tasks manually for now, which does not follow Scrum methodology and is inefficient. We plan on changing this and using either Jira or Github Issues to track our progress and delegate tasks to people in the group.

* We are also planning to change our meeting times and make them more regular. Due to the highly conflicting schedules of everyone in the group, it is difficult to coordinate meetings and thus we cannot have them at a regular time without coordinating many things. We plan on making a schedule and sticking to it so that we do not have to schedule each meeting individually.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

- Allocating different aspects of the MVP to groups of people
  - Allocate the responsibility to implement features in the MVP
    to groups of people
- Finalizing the timeline for the product
  - Have a detailed breakdown of the timeline for the completion 
    of the MVP
- Setting up the database
  - Set up the schema for the databse
  - Ensure everyone understands how to manipulate the database
- Implement Accounts aspect of the product 
  - Implementing the registration page
  - Implementing the login page
  - Separating User Accounts from Admin Accounts
