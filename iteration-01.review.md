# SKYLINE

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: FILL IN THE DATE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY HAD YOUR REVIEW MEETING
 * Where: PHYSICAL LOCATION AND/OR ONLINE

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

 1. In-depth construction of each idea presented allowed for the selection of the best possible project in accordance to the team's skills. Each of the main ideas (Condo App, Info Sharing, Quiz App) were thoroughly researched and considered in terms of viable implementation and consumer demand.
 
2. Consideration of the various ways to implement the project (Website vs. Android App/Desktop Application) and the skills required for each implementation. This uncovered many of the flaws and advantages to each approach allowing us to select the ideal platform.

3. All conflicts within the team during the planning phase were resolved quickly and gracefully. This allowed for the focus to be shifted onto the project itself.


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

1. Coding has been delayed due to a lack of conclusive decisions and initiative. While the planning was very thorough this resulted in a slow start towards actually implementing the selected idea.

2. Indecisiveness in the selection of the project idea delayed the planning of the details related to the implementation itself.

3. Disorganization in the various forms of communication resulted in splintered information. Various important notes are scattered across different apps and websites.



#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

* We are planning to change our modes of communication and task delegation. Until now, we've been communicating on numerous platforms such as Slack, Discord, Messenger, etc. simultaenously, which is making our communication difficult due to having to check so many plaforms for a single piece of information. We plan on moving all of the records and communication onto a single platform to eliminate that problem. We are also delegating tasks manually for now, which does not follow Scrum methodology and is inefficient. We plan on changing this and using either Jira or Github Issues to track our progress and delegate tasks to people in the group.

* We are also planning to change our meeting times and make them more regular. Due to the highly conflicting schedules of everyone in the group, it is difficult to coordinate meetings and thus we cannot have them at a regular time without coordinating many things. We plan on making a schedule and sticking to it so that we do not have to schedule each meeting individually.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.
