#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

We are planning to build a condo management system that allows condos to inform the residents about events, facilities, and other amenities and allows the residents to easily track and use said amenities. For most condos, residents must tediously fill out forms and contact people through multiple layers of the chain of command in order do a task as simple as booking a room for a birthday party. Another inconvenience is having something like a swimming pool but not knowing when it is being cleaned until physically going to the pool itself and finding out. We plan to make tasks like that much more streamlined and efficient. We plan to build a desktop application for the condo owners/managers that they can add events and amenities to, change their attributes, notify the residents, etc. For the residents’ side, we plan to have an android app that they get all of the information on, book amenities with, etc. This would mean that for something like a condo-wide workshop, every resident would be able to know using the app/notifications and attend it easily.


#### Q2: Who are your target users?

* Target users:
   * 1.Condo Management staff( who want to manage their condo efficiently): can schedule events, facilitate bookings and solve logistics or post announcement for their residents.
   * 2.Residents(who want to contact condo management and solve own issues efficiently): connect to their own condo and be able to check events, book facilities and send their issues to condo managements or get notifications from them.

* Personas(examples）:
   * 1.Danny is a male  an experienced  condo management around 40 years old , he works on a computer and use the manage system given to login to different app or webs to do different kinds of things. He hope the system can be developed so  that  he can do all the things on one place and save much time for him.
   
   * 2.Jessie is a female  condo management around 30 year old  ,  she use computer and phone to read all the emails and has to check all the paper forms one by one from the residents. She doesn't  do this work for a long time but she already started to get tired  of it. She wants to go through all the requests from residents quickly and correctly.

   * 3.Lara is a  condo resident, she is 21 years old and studies at U of T . She uses the party room a lot as she wants to play with friends .However, it takes a lot of time for her to book a room every time as she does not know whether the room is available or not and she also needs to visit the management too. She wants to book the party room as soon as possible everytime she plans to have a party.

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

On the one hand, based on our own experience and some of our peers’ experiences, we have realized that oftentimes, condo residents don’t have access to a digital platform to manage their daily condo interactions. Residents require in-person, paper-based communication with the condo administration in order to solve their issues, or in the best case, residents will use an outdated, inefficient website which is not particularly user-friendly in order to achieve this. 

On the other hand, building administration has to deal with a lot of emails, physical forms, etc, which are harder and slower to keep track of.  Thus, our condo management app aims to ease the day to day interactions of residents with their condo amenities and processes as well as to facilitate the interaction between residents and the building’s administration. 

For condo residents, our app will have core features for activities which residents do on a daily basis such as booking amenities, as well as solve other frustrating processes like submitting physical forms to book elevators, signing up to receive packages, etc. The benefit for users would then be that they wouldn’t need to be in the building or even go to the lobby to deal with these issues. Similarly, they would not need to log in to complicated, old websites. Instead, they can go through our app easily and fast, and have a more pleasant experience with it.

For the building administration, our app will also have core features adapted to their daily duties such as sending out announcements and posting events. It would thus help them to have a more appealing and efficient way of communicating with residents so they are up to date about the condo information.

### Highlights

* We made a decision to delay a large part of our planning process in order to research our product. We interviewed building managers, concierges, and residents of condos in order to figure out what they truly wanted from a program like ours. Not doing this would mean we could have started coding faster and done more brainstorming for ideas than taken things people requested. However, interviewing the target audience gives us valuable clarification on the real-life use of the product and lets us plan ahead better and make better features.

* We decided to implement our product using a desktop application and an android app rather than making a website. Most of the group has experience in Java and thus are able to easily start coding in both the former platforms. However, the downside is that it will be difficult to make good looking interfaces and sync up the data between platforms. On the other hand, using only a website can let us make it great and work on a single stable platform, but very few of us have any experience working with websites. Thus, we held a vote, and a majority wanted to stick with their current knowledge base and so we decided to make a desktop application and an android app.

* The biggest decision made was perhaps to go with making a condo management application rather than an alternative called InfoShare or an inventory management application. InfoShare was an information sharing app that let users create a simple profile and share it easily with recruiters at career and recruitment events. The inventory management application was a digital solution for small business owners that had to keep track of their inventory by hand. We did not choose it because the group member proposing it felt that we did not give it enough interest and left the group. The scope of InfoShare was much smaller than that of the condo management, and so we held a vote and chose condo management.
