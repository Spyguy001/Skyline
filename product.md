#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

We are planning to build a condo management system that allows condos to inform the residents about events, facilities, and other amenities and allows the residents to easily track and use said amenities. For most condos, residents must tediously fill out forms and contact people through multiple layers of the chain of command in order do a task as simple as booking a room for a birthday party. Another inconvenience is having something like a swimming pool but not knowing when it is being cleaned until physically going to the pool itself and finding out. We plan to make tasks like that much more streamlined and efficient. We plan to build a desktop application for the condo owners/managers that they can add events and amenities to, change their attributes, notify the residents, etc. For the residentsâ€™ side, we plan to have an android app that they get all of the information on, book amenities with, etc. This would mean that for something like a condo-wide workshop, every resident would be able to know using the app/notifications and attend it easily.

 * Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * Be specific (e.g. )
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to use personas.        
   You can create your personas as part of this Markdown file, or add a link to an external site (for example, [Xtensio](https://xtensio.com/user-persona/)).

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE ...

 * Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * We want you to "connect the dots" for us - Why does your product (as described in your answer to Q1) fits the needs of your users (as described in your answer to Q2)?
 * Explain the benefits of your product explicitly & clearly. For example:
    * Save users time (how much?)
    * Allow users to discover new information (which information? And, why couldn't they discover it before?)
    * Provide users with more accurate and/or informative data (what kind of data? Why is it useful to them?)

### Highlights

* We made a decision to delay a large part of our planning process in order to research our product. We interviewed building managers, concierges, and residents of condos in order to figure out what they truly wanted from a program like ours. Not doing this would mean we could have started coding faster and done more brainstorming for ideas than taken things people requested. However, interviewing the target audience gives us valuable clarification on the real-life use of the product and lets us plan ahead better and make better features.

* We decided to implement our product using a desktop application and an android app rather than making a website. Most of the group has experience in Java and thus are able to easily start coding in both the former platforms. However, the downside is that it will be difficult to make good looking interfaces and sync up the data between platforms. On the other hand, using only a website can let us make it great and work on a single stable platform, but very few of us have any experience working with websites. Thus, we held a vote, and a majority wanted to stick with their current knowledge base and so we decided to make a desktop application and an android app.

* The biggest decision made was perhaps to go with making a condo management application rather than an alternative called InfoShare or an inventory management application. InfoShare was an information sharing app that let users create a simple profile and share it easily with recruiters at career and recruitment events. The inventory management application was a digital solution for small business owners that had to keep track of their inventory by hand. We did not choose it because the group member proposing it felt that we did not give it enough interest and left the group. The scope of InfoShare was much smaller than that of the condo management, and so we held a vote and chose condo management.
