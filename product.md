#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

We are planning to build a condo management system that allows condos to inform the residents about events, facilities, and other amenities and allows the residents to easily track and use said amenities. For most condos, residents must tediously fill out forms and contact people through multiple layers of the chain of command in order do a task as simple as booking a room for a birthday party. Another inconvenience is having something like a swimming pool but not knowing when it is being cleaned until physically going to the pool itself and finding out. We plan to make tasks like that much more streamlined and efficient. We plan to build a desktop application for the condo owners/managers that they can add events and amenities to, change their attributes, notify the residents, etc. For the residents’ side, we plan to have an android app that they get all of the information on, book amenities with, etc. This would mean that for something like a condo-wide workshop, every resident would be able to know using the app/notifications and attend it easily.


#### Q2: Who are your target users?

* Target users:
   * 1.Condo Management staff( who want to manage their condo efficiently): can schedule events, facilitate bookings and solve logistics or post announcement for their residents.
   * 2.Residents(who want to contact condo management and solve own issues efficiently): connect to their own condo and be able to check events, book facilities and send their issues to condo managements or get notifications from them.

* Personas(examples）:
   * 1.Danny is a male  an experienced  condo management around 40 years old , he works on a computer and use the manage system given to login to different app or webs to do different kinds of things. He hope the system can be developed so  that  he can do all the things on one place and save much time for him.
   
   * 2.Jessie is a female  condo management around 30 year old  ,  she use computer and phone to read all the emails and has to check all the paper forms one by one from the residents. She doesn't  do this work for a long time but she already started to get tired  of it. She wants to go through all the requests from residents quickly and correctly.

   * 3.Lara is a  condo resident, she is 21 years old and studies at U of T . She uses the party room a lot as she wants to play with friends .However, it takes a lot of time for her to book a room every time as she does not know whether the room is available or not and she also needs to visit the management too. She wants to book the party room as soon as possible everytime she plans to have a party.

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

Condo residents sometimes don’t have access to a digital platform to manage their daily condo interactions. Instead, they require in-person, paper-based communication with the condo administration in order to solve their issues. Other times, residents have will use a website platform such as BuildingLink or FrontDesk. However, these are outdated, inefficient and not user-friendly.

On the other hand, building administration has to deal with a lot of emails, physical forms, etc, which are harder and slower to keep track of.  Thus, our condo management app aims to ease the day to day interactions of residents with their condo amenities and processes as well as to facilitate the interaction between residents and the building’s administration. 

Based on the description of our condo app in question 1, the benefit for residents would then be that they wouldn’t need to be in the building or even go to the lobby to deal with these issues. Similarly, they would not need to log in to complicated, old websites. Instead, they can go through our app easily and fast, and have a more pleasant experience with it. The benefit for the building's administration is that they would have a more appealing and efficient way of communicating with residents so they are up to date and engaged with what takes place in the condo.

### Highlights

#### Deciding on the project idea

The biggest decision made was perhaps to go with making a condo management application rather than an alternative called InfoShare or an inventory management application. The following is a list briefing each idea, and the key drawback in pursing it:

* InfoShare: An app that eliminates the inefficient exchange of information through paper (brochures, leaflets, sign up sheets) during job/club fairs. People could scan a code provided by recruiters to establish a connection through which they could send information (contact details, resume) and receive information (club website, job requirements, etc). *Drawback:* Members of the team felt it was too easy, and did not require 6 people to implement it. Existing technologies such as QR code scanning, bluetooth and NFC would simplify a lot of the backend development.

* Condo Management: The idea we chose to go with, details of this idea can be found in the earlier sections of this document. *Drawback:* None of the team members are experienced in the domain of managing condos. Development would be delayed as we would need to contact existing condo managers to gain an understanding of their problems and how to solve them.

* Inventory Management: A digital solution for small business owners that had to keep track of their inventory by hand. *Drawback:* The member who proposed this idea left our team and formed another one. 

So when the vote was held, team members chose condo management, as it was much better to spend some time researching, than pursing a project whose scope was too small or using a former teammate's idea. 

#### Other decisions

* We made a decision to delay a large part of our planning process in order to research our product. We interviewed building managers, concierges, and residents of condos in order to figure out what they truly wanted from a program like ours. Not doing this has given us valuable clarification on the real-life use of the product and has let us plan ahead better and make better features.

* We decided to implement our product using a desktop application and an android app rather than making a website. Most of the group has experience in Java and thus are able to easily start coding in both the former platforms. However, the downside is that it will be difficult to make good looking interfaces and sync up the data between platforms. On the other hand, using only a website can let us make it great and work on a single stable platform, but very few of us have any experience working with websites. Thus, we held a vote, and a majority wanted to stick with their current knowledge base and so we decided to make a desktop application and an android app.
